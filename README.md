# word_guessing_game
Python is a powerful multi-purpose programming language used by multiple giant companies. I used random module to make a word guessing game. 
In this game, there is a list of words present, will choose 1 random word. The user first has to input their names and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet. 
If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output(with correct placement) else the program will ask you to guess another alphabet.
